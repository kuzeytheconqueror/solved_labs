# How to Test for DOM-Based Cross-Site Scripting

The majority of DOM XSS vulnerabilities can be found quickly and reliably using Burp Suite's web vulnerability scanner. To test for DOM-based cross-site scripting manually, you generally need to use a browser with developer tools, such as Chrome. You need to work through each available source in turn, and test each one individually.

### Testing HTML sinks

To test for DOM XSS in an HTML sink, place a random alphanumeric string into the source (such as `location.search`), then use developer tools to inspect the HTML and find where your string appears. Note that the browser's "View source" option won't work for DOM XSS testing because it doesn't take account of changes that have been performed in the HTML by JavaScript. In Chrome's developer tools, you can use `Control+F` (or `Command+F` on MacOS) to search the DOM for your string.

For each location where your string appears within the DOM, you need to identify the context. Based on this context, you need to refine your input to see how it is processed. For example, if your string appears within a double-quoted attribute then try to inject double quotes in your string to see if you can break out of the attribute.

Note that browsers behave differently with regard to URL-encoding: Chrome, Firefox, and Safari will URL-encode `location.search` and `location.hash`, while IE11 and Microsoft Edge (pre-Chromium) will not URL-encode these sources. If your data gets URL-encoded before being processed, then an XSS attack is unlikely to work.

### Testing JavaScript execution sinks

Testing JavaScript execution sinks for DOM-based XSS is a little harder. With these sinks, your input doesn't necessarily appear anywhere within the DOM, so you can't search for it. Instead you'll need to use the JavaScript debugger to determine whether and how your input is sent to a sink.

For each potential source, such as `location`, you first need to find cases within the page's JavaScript code where the source is being referenced. In Chrome's developer tools, you can use `Control+Shift+F` (or `Command+Alt+F` on MacOS) to search all the page's JavaScript code for the source.

Once you've found where the source is being read, you can use the JavaScript debugger to add a break point and follow how the source's value is used. You might find that the source gets assigned to other variables. If this is the case, you'll need to use the search function again to track these variables and see if they're passed to a sink. When you find a sink that is being assigned data that originated from the source, you can use the debugger to inspect the value by hovering over the variable to show its value before it is sent to the sink. Then, as with HTML sinks, you need to refine your input to see if you can deliver a successful XSS attack.

### Testing for DOM XSS using DOM Invader

Identifying and exploiting DOM XSS in the wild can be a tedious process, often requiring you to manually trawl through complex, minified JavaScript. If you use Burp's browser, however, you can take advantage of its built-in DOM Invader extension, which does a lot of the hard work for you.
