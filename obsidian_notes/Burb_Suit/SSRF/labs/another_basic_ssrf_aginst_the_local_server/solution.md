# The Burbsuit solution: 



    Visit a product, click Check stock, intercept the request in Burp Suite, and send it to Burp Intruder.
    Change the stockApi parameter to http://192.168.0.1:8080/admin then highlight the final octet of the IP address (the number 1) and click Add §.
    In the Payloads side panel, change the payload type to Numbers, and enter 1, 255, and 1 in the From and To and Step boxes respectively.
    Click Start attack.
    Click on the Status column to sort it by status code ascending. You should see a single entry with a status of 200, showing an admin interface.
    Click on this request, send it to Burp Repeater, and change the path in the stockApi to: /admin/delete?username=carlos


# My Solution. 

I wrote a script at this folder. This is a script runs for all possible IP's at the subdomain and then detects the spesific IP with admin. 

Then it deletes it with the request but there are some bugs at this part. So I will update it.
