The most effective way to prevent OS command injection vulnerabilities is to never call out to OS commands from application-layer code. In almost all cases, there are different ways to implement the required functionality using safer platform APIs.

If you have to call out to OS commands with user-supplied input, then you must perform strong input validation. Some examples of effective validation include:

- Validating against a whitelist of permitted values.
- Validating that the input is a number.
- Validating that the input contains only alphanumeric characters, no other syntax or whitespace.

Never attempt to sanitize input by escaping shell metacharacters. In practice, this is just too error-prone and vulnerable to being bypassed by a skilled attacker.
