# Lab: Blind OS command injection with time delays

This lab contains a blind OS command injection vulnerability in the feedback function.

The application executes a shell command containing the user-supplied details. The output from the command is not returned in the response.

To solve the lab, exploit the blind OS command injection vulnerability to cause a 10 second delay.

## Official Solution

1. Use Burp Suite to intercept and modify the request that submits feedback.
2. Modify the `email` parameter, changing it to:
    
    `email=x||ping+-c+10+127.0.0.1||`
3. Observe that the response takes 10 seconds to return.
